A collection of experiments with memory allocation.

Largely here to experiment with kernel-side behaviour under different allocation scenarios.

See [linux-vm-notes][linux-vm-notes] and [linux-vm-hacks][linux-vm-hacks] for
more on my experiments with memory.

A lot of this might seem rather pointless + arbitrary but it's super-useful to
have small controlled programs that allocate for experimenting with kernel
behaviour.
